Starting from the assumption of proposing non-human perspectives, the element of ice tells its own possible story, aiming to provoke and activate reflections on the relationship between human beings and nature. A fictional organization, which communicate through all the necessary corollary, unfold a futuristic scenario while involving the human being / user in interactive experience, which is essential to understand the narrative.

I.C.E. (Insurge, Commit, Extinguish) is a terrorist organization that communicates through the necessary visual complement, revealing a potential future scenario in which ice declares war against humanity, aiming to reclaim what has been taken from it and put an end to the harmful coexistence that humiliates and destroys nature.
I.C.E. bombs are everywhere, with a timer set for a few minutes that accelerates if someone tries to get closer. The only way to stop them is to touch their cold surface, but as soon as the contact ends, time resumes until it runs out. The detonation of the bomb will cause an environmental catastrophe, causing terror and destruction.
Human beings, powerless and subservient to this reality, are forced to face disasters on disasters without being able to do anything to stop them.

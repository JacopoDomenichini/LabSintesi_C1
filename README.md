Communication design project, the results from an experimental educational path based on the risk of trying new solutions and techniques 
and verifying them on a real scale. Design speculations that are not meant to give answers and certainties: their aim is to imagine new 
questions and reflect on contemporary and future times. A learning path that intends to go beyond the centrality of t√©chne, to encourage 
the wielding of knowledge.

What if the ice declared war on humankind?
Ice, while trying to coexist with the human species, has given up too much, for too long. Humans, blinded by their egocentrism and hunger for 
power, have brought it dangerously close to extinction, making it weaker and weaker. This led to the rise of the terrorist organisation I.C.E. (Insurge, Commit, Extinguish), which declares war to mankind. Their goal is to claim back what has been taken from them, joining forces to spread their ideology and put an end to an harmful coexistence with what humiliates and destroys nature: human beings.I.C.E. attacks our everyday life through a silent action, which spreads all over the world with posters, graffiti, threats. No one knows who these terrorists are, but anyone could be one of them. I.C.E. bombs are everywhere. Their timer only lasts for a few minutes and speeds up if anyone tries to get close. The only way to stop the bombs is to keep a hand on their freezing surface; as soon as the contact ends, however, the clock starts running down again. The bomb explodes, triggering an environmental catastrophe at a specific point on earth, causing terror and destruction. Humanity proves to be powerless when compared to the inexorability of ice. Succumbing to this reality, humans are forced to face disaster after disaster, without actually being able to do anything to stop the massacre except from postponing an inevitable fate.
